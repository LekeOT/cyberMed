                <h3>WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT INSIDER THREATS</h3>
                <h5>What is Insider Threat Attack</h5>
                <p>An insider threat attack is a security breach or malicious activity carried out by someone within an organization, such as an employee, contractor, or business partner, who has authorized access to the organization's systems, data, or facilities. These individuals can exploit their privileges to steal sensitive information, damage systems, or disrupt operations, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
                <h5>How can you detect Insider Threat attacks in your workplace?</h5>
                <p>These are some important tips on how to detect insider threat attacks in your workplace as healthcare workers. Please keep these points in mind:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sudden changes in behavior or job performance:</b> Look for sudden changes in a coworker's behavior, such as increased stress levels, unexplained absences, or a significant decline in job performance. These changes could indicate that the individual is struggling with personal issues that could lead to insider threat activity.</li><br>
                <li><b>Disgruntled employees:</b> Pay attention to colleagues who exhibit signs of dissatisfaction, frustration, or resentment towards the organization or their job. Disgruntled employees may be more likely to engage in insider threat activities as a form of retaliation or due to a perceived sense of injustice. Open communication and prompt resolution of workplace conflicts can help address potential insider threat risks associated with disgruntled employees.</li><br>
                <li><b>Unexplained wealth or lifestyle changes:</b> Watch for sudden or unexplained changes in a colleague's financial situation or lifestyle, such as extravagant purchases, frequent high-end vacations, or other signs of living beyond their means. These changes could suggest that the individual is involved in illicit activities, such as selling sensitive information or participating in other forms of insider threat activities for personal gain.</li><br>
                <li><b>Sudden departure or resignation:</b> Be cautious if a colleague suddenly resigns or leaves the organization without a clear reason or explanation. This could indicate that the individual was involved in insider threat activities and is trying to avoid detection or accountability. In such cases, it's essential to promptly review the departing employee's access history, data usage, and communication records to uncover any potential security breaches or malicious activities.</li><br>
                <li><b>Unusual access patterns:</b> Keep an eye out for unusual access patterns, such as employees accessing sensitive information or systems they don't typically interact with, accessing data outside of their normal working hours, or logging in from unfamiliar locations.</li><br>
                
            </ul>
                <h5>Prevention is better than cure</h5>
                <p>These are simple and straightforward ways you can prevent Insider threats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Adhere to policies and procedures:</b> Consistently follow your organization's security policies and procedures, such as maintaining strong and unique passwords, using secure communication channels, and following data access guidelines.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Report suspicious activities promptly:</b> As a healthcare worker, you should actively contribute to your organization's security by promptly reporting any suspicious activities or potential security risks you may encounter. Familiarize yourself with the reporting guidelines and use the available channels to share your concerns without fear of retaliation. By fostering open communication and taking a proactive approach to security, you can play a vital role in the early detection and prevention of insider threat attacks.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Foster a positive work environment:</b> As a healthcare worker, it's essential to create and maintain a supportive and inclusive workplace culture. Encourage open communication, address conflicts constructively, and promote employee well-being. By fostering a positive work environment, you can help reduce the risk of disgruntled employees engaging in insider threat activities.</li><br>
