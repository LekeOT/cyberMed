                <h3>WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT E-MAIL PHISHING</h3>
                <h5>What is E-Mail Phishing</h5>
                <p>Email phishing is a deceptive technique used by cybercriminals to trick people into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card details, by sending fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate sources. <br><br>These emails often contain links or attachments that, when clicked or opened, lead to fake websites or install malware, allowing the attacker to steal the victim's data or gain unauthorized access to their accounts.</p>
                <h5>How can you detect E-Mail Phishing attacks in your workplace?</h5>
                <p>These are some important tips on how to detect email phishing attacks in your workplace as healthcare workers. Please keep these points in mind while going through your emails:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Carefully inspect the sender's email address:</b> Teach yourself to pay attention to the sender's email address for any inconsistencies or odd characters. Remember, phishing emails often use addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but have minor differences.</li><br>
                <li><b>Look for grammatical and spelling errors:</b> Always be mindful of any spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or unusual phrasing in emails, punctuation, as these can be warning signs of a phishing attempt.</li><br>
                <li><b>Practice caution with links and attachments:</b> Make it a habit to avoid clicking on links or opening attachments from unfamiliar sources. Always hover over a link to preview the destination URL before clicking, and be wary of unexpected file attachments.</li><br>
                <li><b>Assess the email's tone and content:</b> Phishing emails may try to use urgency, fear, or curiosity to manipulate your actions. Be critical of any email that asks for sensitive information or demands immediate action.</li><br>
                <li><b>Personal Information:</b> Reputable companies never request sensitive information through email. Any communication prompting you to input or confirm personal details or banking/credit card information should be considered major warning signs.</li><br>
                <li><b>Confirm the email's authenticity:</b> If you're unsure about an email, reach out to the person or organization it claims to be from using a trusted contact method, such as a phone number you find on their official website, to verify the email's legitimacy.</li><br>
                <li><b>Check for secure website indicators:</b> When an email directs you to a website, ensure there's a secure connection by looking for <i>"https://"</i> in the URL and a padlock icon in the address bar.</li><br>
                <li><b>Stay informed and educated:</b> Participate in cybersecurity training regularly and keep yourself updated on the latest phishing trends and tactics. This knowledge will help you effectively recognize and prevent phishing attacks in your professional environment.</li><br>
            </ul>
                <h5>Prevention is better than cure</h5>
                <p>These are simple and straightforward ways you can prevent E-Mail Phishing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Try not to use public networks:</b> Email exchanges on public networks are frequently unencrypted, making it easier for hackers to intercept crucial information such as usernames, passwords, and financial details. Unethical hackers may even establish free hotspots to entice you into divulging sensitive data without the need for advanced data interception tools. To avoid phishing attempts when using public networks, it's best to utilize your mobile device's tethering and hotspot features, relying on its 3G/4G data connection instead of public networks.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Beware of shortened links:</b> Shortened links can conceal a website's true identity, making it easier for recipients to be deceived into clicking them. Cybercriminals may use such links to redirect you to counterfeit websites that resemble legitimate ones, with the intent of capturing your sensitive information. To avoid this, always hover your cursor over the shortened link to reveal the destination URL before clicking on it.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Watch out for pop-ups:</b> Through the use of iframe technology, pop-ups can capture personal information and transmit it to a domain other than the one displayed in the browser toolbar. Well-known, reputable websites seldom request sensitive data entry via pop-ups. As a general guideline, avoid entering personal information in pop-ups, even if they appear on domains with valid SSL certificates and have passed all other phishing checks.</li>
