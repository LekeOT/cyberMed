                <h3>WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT RANSOMWARE ATTACKS</h3>
                <h5>What is Ransomware attack</h5>
                <p>A ransomware attack is a type of cyberattack where malicious software, known as ransomware, infects a computer or network, encrypts the victim's data, and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.<br><br>The attacker typically threatens to permanently delete the encrypted data or publish it publicly if the ransom is not paid within a specific timeframe, causing significant disruption and potential financial loss for the affected individual or organization.</p>
                <h5>How can you detect Ransomware attacks in your workplace?</h5>
                <p>These are some important tips on how to detect ransomware attacks in your workplace as healthcare workers. Please keep these points in mind while going through your emails:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Stay vigilant for phishing emails:</b> Since ransomware attacks often start with phishing emails, be cautious of unexpected emails containing suspicious links or attachments.</li><br>
                <li><b>Check for unusual system behavior:</b> If you notice unusual computer or network behavior, such as slow performance, frequent crashes, or inaccessible files, report it immediately to your IT department, as it could be a sign of a ransomware infection.</li><br>
                <li><b>Monitor file extensions:</b> Be aware of any changes to file extensions or filenames, as ransomware often renames files with new extensions after encrypting them.</li><br>
                <li><b>Be cautious with suspicious pop-ups:</b> Ransomware attacks can also be initiated through malicious pop-up ads or fake software updates. Avoid clicking on suspicious pop-ups or downloading software from untrusted sources.</li><br>
                <li><b>Regularly back up your data:</b> Regularly backing up your data can help minimize the impact of a ransomware attack by allowing you to restore your files from a secure backup if your system gets infected.</li><br>
                <li><b>Educate yourself and colleagues:</b> Stay informed about the latest ransomware threats and their indicators, and share this knowledge with your colleagues to create a more secure workplace.</li><br>
            </ul>
                <h5>Prevention is better than cure</h5>
                <p>These are simple and straightforward ways you can prevent Ransomware attacks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Be cautious with emails:</b> Don't click on suspicious links or open unexpected attachments in emails, as phishing campaigns often distribute ransomware.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Suspicious links to external URLs:</b> Shortened links can conceal a website's true identity, making it easier for recipients to be deceived into clicking them. Cybercriminals may use such links to redirect you to counterfeit websites that resemble legitimate ones, with the intent of capturing your sensitive information. To avoid this, always hover your cursor over the shortened link to reveal the destination URL before clicking on it.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Train and educate staff:</b> Regularly participate in cybersecurity training to stay informed about the latest threats and best practices for preventing ransomware attacks.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Suspicious file attachments:</b> Exercise caution with suspicious file attachments to prevent ransomware. Verify the sender's identity and context before opening any attachments. Reach out to the sender to confirm legitimacy (if needed). Keep antivirus software updated and configured to scan attachments.</li>
                </ul>
