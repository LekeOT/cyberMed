                <h3>WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT DDoS ATTACKS</h3>
                <h5>What is Distributed Denial of Service attack?</h5>
                <p>A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is a cyberattack where multiple systems, usually compromised by malware, work together to flood a targeted website or network with an overwhelming amount of traffic.<br><br> This bombardment of requests causes the target's resources to become overloaded, making the website or network slow or entirely unavailable for legitimate users.</p>
                <h5>How can you detect DDoS attacks in your workplace?</h5>
                <p>These are some important tips on how to detect DDoS attacks in your workplace as healthcare workers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Slow network performance:</b> If websites, applications, or internal systems suddenly become very slow or unresponsive, it could be an indication of a DDoS attack.</li><br>
                <li><b>Inability to access online resources:</b> If multiple users are unable to access specific websites or network resources, it could be a sign of a targeted attack.</li><br>
                <li><b>Intermittent connectivity:</b> Frequent disconnects and reconnects or fluctuating network performance could be a symptom of an ongoing DDoS attack.</li><br>
                <li><b>Unexplained spikes in network traffic:</b> If your organization monitors network traffic, unusual spikes or patterns could signal a DDoS attack.</li><br>
                <li><b>Educate yourself and colleagues:</b> Stay informed about the latest DDoS threats and their indicators, and share this knowledge with your colleagues to create a more secure workplace.</li><br>
            </ul>
                <h5>Prevention is better than cure</h5>
                <p>These are simple and straightforward ways you can prevent DDoS attacks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Report unusual network activity:</b> Promptly inform your IT department of any suspicious network behavior or performance issues, as this information can help them detect and mitigate potential DDoS attacks.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Participate in cybersecurity training:</b> SRegularly attend cybersecurity training sessions to stay informed about potential threats, including DDoS attacks, and learn the best practices for maintaining a secure network environment.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Practice good cybersecurity hygiene:</b> Use strong, unique passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and keep your devices updated with the latest security patches to reduce the risk of your devices being compromised and used in a DDoS attack.</li><br>
                </ul>
